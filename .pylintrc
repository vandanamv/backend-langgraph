# Ensure pylint adds the project root to sys.path so imports like
# `from backend.app import app` resolve during linting.
# Use the current working directory which is reliable for editors/IDEs
# that run pylint with the workspace root as the CWD.

# Optionally you can configure other pylint settings here.
